        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This university project started with a single rule: choose an everyday object,
          carefully deconstruct it, and rebuild it into something with a completely new
          purpose. I selected an old calculator and transformed it into a small
          <strong>Whac-A-Mole–inspired toy</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calculator was dismantled into its components—buttons, casing, circuit board
          and screen. By laying everything out, I began to see each piece as a material
          rather than a fixed object. The buttons suggested a game interface, which led to
          the idea of building a playful whac-a-mole character out of the salvaged parts.
        </p>

        <h3>Module & Context</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Module:</strong> 2223 – Objects and Installation + Interactive Media + Sounding<br>
          <strong>Focus:</strong> Deconstruction, reconstruction, and playful object design
        </p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          I rebuilt the calculator into a new structure, using the original keys as a game
          surface and rearranging other components to create a small character “stage”.
          Additional materials and sculpted details were added to give the object more
          personality and stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process involved problem-solving around balance, wiring and composition,
          while still revealing traces of the original calculator. The result is a
          hand-made object that sits somewhere between sculpture, toy and prototype.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project helped me see familiar things in a different way and reduced my fear
          of “breaking” devices. It also encouraged sustainable thinking—treating old
          electronics as creative material rather than rubbish—and strengthened my
          confidence in hands-on making.

        <h2>Game Prototype & Animation</h2>
        <p>
          After building the physical object, I extended the project into
          <strong>interactive media</strong>. I designed a mobile game in
          <strong>Adobe XD</strong> that turns the reconstructed calculator into a character
          inside a whac-a-mole style game. The physical object becomes the in-game
          interface and visual motif.
        </p>
        <p>
          The prototype explores screen flow, user states and simple interactions.
          Players tap to “whack” the character, while the interface keeps the playful,
          handmade feeling of the original object.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside the game prototype, I created a <strong>stop-motion animation</strong>
          featuring the physical toy. The animation combines frame-by-frame motion and
          sound design to bring the character to life and imagine how it could exist in a
          narrative context.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Explored</h3>

          <li>Translating a physical installation into a digital game experience</li>
          <li>Designing UI screens and flows in Adobe XD</li>
          <li>Using stop-motion and sound to build character and mood</li>
